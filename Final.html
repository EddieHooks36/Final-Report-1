        <p>Hello my name is Eddie. From 2009 to 2015 I served in the US Army. After deciding to get out of the Army, I started going to school for IT although that wasn't my job in the military I wanted to try something new. It was rough learning something new that I've never done before but it turned out to be the best decision I've made for myself and my family. I am currently working for an Architect company as the System Administrator. I am also in charge of the company website which we use Wordpress as the host. After taking over the website, I became extremely intrigued in learning more about coding and want to become an expert at it, which is why I decided to take this course.</p>
